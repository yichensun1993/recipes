1 whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces and skin removed
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon paprika, or to taste
1 tablespoon butter
1 apple, cored and chopped
1 onion, chopped
1 tablespoon curry powder, or more to taste
1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
1 cup half-and-half cream


1. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

2. Arrange the chicken pieces in a single layer in a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Season the chicken liberally with salt, pepper, and the paprika; set aside.

3. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the apple and onion to the melted butter, 
season with the curry powder, and cook and stir until the apple and onion are tender, 7 to 10 minutes.
Stir the mushroom soup and half-and-half into the mixture until completely combined; spoon over the chicken pieces.
 
4. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 75 minutes.
An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 82 degrees C.
